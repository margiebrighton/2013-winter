<p>EID 100 is one of two digital specialization courses at Ryerson University (the other being EID 500). After completion of these two courses you get a digital specialization label on your University transcript. It is such an amazing course because you get to learn how to use tools like Prezi, Haiku, Google docs, and even Github. You also learn how to create your first app! Which can be used online or even downloaded onto your iPhone/Android. You also learn basic programming using languages such as HTML, Java, CSS, and many more!.</p>
